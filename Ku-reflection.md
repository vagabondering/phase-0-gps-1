<li><p>What concepts were clarified during the GPS?</p><p>I was more clarified about the git commit usage, how I don't have to specify a file with the command. I was also more clarified about knowing the differene between git fetch and merge.</p></li>

<li><p>What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?</p><p>I asked questions about branch naming, if the origin name gets used in the proffessional world, about the difference between merge and fetch and when and how often the pulling and merging of the master to your branch happens.</p></li>

<li><p>What still confuses you about git?</p><p>I feel that I generally understand git pretty well, I do think that it can become a little more complex workflow when workin with multiple people and larger files when merging the changes into the master branch.</p></li>

<li><p>How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?</p><p>I really enjoyed the first GPS, it was extremely helpful in terms of explaining anything more in depth and making me feel more comfortable having to gain more knowledge.</p></li>
